# FreeExamples.NuGetClientPublisher

Interactive console tool for packing and publishing the `FreeExamples.Client` NuGet package. Wraps `dotnet pack` and `dotnet nuget push` behind a safety menu with dry-run mode.

---

## What It Does

`FreeExamples.NuGetClientPublisher` is an interactive CLI that guides you through the pack-and-publish workflow for the `FreeExamples.NuGetClient` library. It reads configuration from `appsettings.json` and user secrets, supports dry-run mode so you can preview operations without making live changes, and lets you look up existing versions on NuGet.org before pushing.

---

## Command-Line Arguments

```
dotnet run                         # Start the interactive menu (reads appsettings.json)
dotnet run -- --version 1.2.3     # Override the package version before starting
```

---

## Interactive Menu

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `1` | View current configuration |
| `2` | Verify the project builds |
| `3` | Pack — produces `.nupkg` |
| `4` | Push to NuGet.org |
| `5` | Full publish (Clean → Build → Pack → Push) |
| `L` | Look up existing versions on NuGet.org |
| `V` | Change version number for this session |
| `D` | Toggle dry-run mode (default: ON) |
| `0` | Exit |

Dry-run mode is enabled by default. No changes are made until you toggle it off with `D`.

## Configuration (appsettings.json)

```json
{
  "NuGet": {
    "PackageId":    "FreeExamples.Client",
    "Version":      "1.0.0",
    "Source":       "https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json",
    "ProjectPath":  "FreeExamples.NuGetClient\\FreeExamples.NuGetClient.csproj",
    "SolutionRoot": "",
    "Configuration": "Release",
    "SkipDuplicate": true,
    "IncludeSymbols": true
  }
}
```

Store the NuGet API key in user secrets (never commit it):

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "NuGet:ApiKey" "your-nuget-api-key"
```

## 🧭 Plain-English Briefing — The Boss Questions

**How does this work?** An interactive console tool that packs and publishes the `FreeExamples.Client` NuGet package. It wraps `dotnet pack` / `dotnet nuget push` behind a menu, starts in **dry-run mode**, can look up existing versions on NuGet.org, and reads its config from `appsettings.json` + user secrets (API key never committed).

**What tech & where?** [Program.cs](https://github.com/WSU-EIT/FreeAI/blob/main/FreeTools/FreeExamples/FreeExamples.NuGetClientPublisher/Program.cs).

**Why does this exist?** Publishing a package by hand is easy to get wrong; this makes the pack-and-push repeatable and safe (preview before you push).

**What does it beat?** **Dry-run by default** and a version-lookup before pushing, so you don't accidentally publish or overwrite. (A near-twin of `FreeGLBA.NugetClientPublisher`.)

**Terminology:** **Pack** — build the `.nupkg`; **push** — upload it to NuGet.org.

**The hard part, drawn:**
```
  (dry-run ON) ─▶ Verify build ─▶ Pack (.nupkg) ─▶ look up live versions
        toggle LIVE ─▶ Push to NuGet.org   (API key from user secrets)
```
