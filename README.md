# FreeCRM 

An open-source CRM solution built in C# Blazor WebAssembly using .NET 9. You can use this project as-is,
or customize it to fit your needs. Or, just grab code that you need to use in your project.

If you want to rename things, you can use the "CRM - Rename App Files.linq" LINQPad
script. LINQPad is a great tool for developing C# code and can be downloaded from
https://linqpad.net/.
